# Gender Experiment

## Synopsis
R Code and reporting output for randomized causal inference study to answer question on whether there is bias in following directions from gendered voices. 

## Research Proposal
The experimental study attempts to isolate the effects that a speakerâ€™s gender has on the willingness of a targeted listener to follow through on the direction of the speaker. The purpose is to provide insight on whether the verbal directions of men are more effective than that of women in steering behavior though some simple game playing. The experiment should serve to examine the existence of the effect and the strength of the effect, if it exists. 

## Research Question: 
Is there a gender bias in the response to audio (voice) directions?

## Methodology:
Randomized control trials to assess response to genderized audio commands.
